          What's The Frequency are an exciting new act that blends rich melodies
          with a deep sense of nostalgia. The Tullamore based group is made up
          of long-time friends Ian, Patrick, and Brendan, who have recently come
          together to collaborate on their individual musical journeys. Drawing
          from their experiences both at home and abroad, the groups songwriting
          evokes a powerful sense of longing for times past while still pushing
          forward with optimism and hope. Lyrically, they craft stories around
          the experiences of growing up, coming of age, and navigating the
          complexities of adolescence. Having performed both in Ireland and
          abroad in Vancouver, they aim to forge a personal connection with
          audiences, stirring a range of emotions through their lyrics and
          melodies. Catch them at the Croilar Festival in April, where they’ll
          bring their unique blend of nostalgic melodies and fresh sounds.
